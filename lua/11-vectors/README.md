# 11. Vectors

Vectors are a crucial component of game programming. Just like in mathemetics a videogame vector stores a magnitude and a direction in either 2d or 3d space.

Games programming is rife with concepts that need both magnitude and direction to make sense, for example:

1. Your player movement direction and speed
2. Wind direction and speed
3. Gravity

This tutorial covers where you should use vectors and walk you through some of the clever, time-saving tricks you can pull off with them.
