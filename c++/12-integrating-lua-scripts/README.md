# 12. Integrating Lua Scripts

The 32blit Lua engine is just another 32blit application that just happens to run a game implemented entirely in Lua.

What if you wanted to mix the benefits of C++ heavy lifting, with the easy tweakability of Lua in your own game?

This tutorial covers taking 32blit Lua and using it as the code for your own customisable game.
